This is an app similar to Soundcloud, Mixcloud or HearThis where users can upload their DJ mixes
for others to listen to. It is built on a VueJS frontend, Laravel backend and a MySQL 9 database.

## Todo:

- [ ] Setup Vue Audio Visual - https://github.com/staskobzar/vue-audio-visual
- [ ] Setup Tailwind CSS

### Backend
- [ ] Setup Laravel
- [ ] Init API mode
- [ ] Setup MySQL 9 locally

### Other
- [ ] Find a free service to create a task board or host something on a raspberry pi 

### Functionality

- [ ] Forgot credentials feature
- [ ] Upload mixes (MP3 or WAV)
- [ ] List mixes they have uploaded
- [ ] Profile page
- [ ] Follow other users
- [ ] Dashboard page with mixes of users followed
- [ ] Stats of listeners and how many plays etc
- [ ] Search for users or mixes

### Docker
This will come later when the project is at a decent point
- [ ] Setup and containerise Vue JS frontend
- [ ] Install Sail on the backend
- [ ] Update Sail MySQL to version 9
- [ ] Make global docker compose file including the files from both directories

### React Native
Will need to flesh this out more but not a high priority for a mobile app
